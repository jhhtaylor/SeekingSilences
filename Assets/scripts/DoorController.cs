* Interacting with Doors | Unity
*
* This simple script is to interact with doors (open/close) when the player presses "E"
*
* Full tutorial available at:
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nONlAXpCkag
*/

/*
* How to use:
* 1- Attach this script to your player
* 2- Make sure that the player has Rigidbody and Collider components
* 3- The door's parent has a collider with trigger checked
* 4- Door's parent has the tag "Door"
* 5- The door itself has an Animator and it has a parameter of type trigger called "OpenClose"
*    which is responsible for the transition between opening and closing.
